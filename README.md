# Israel mock data generator

Tools that help to generate realistic mock data for Israel oriented use-cases.

## Development

```
poetry install
poetry run ilmockgen --help
```

on Windows you should probably do (if running from gitBash)
```
 export PYTHONUTF8=1
 ```
 or
  `set PYTHONUTF8=1` (if you run from a CMD window)

This is in order to get the Hebrew correctly on the HTML pages.
